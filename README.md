# 3D-XVIGR

This repository is for 3D-XVIGR, a work done at the ADL4CV course at TUM.
It is based on 3-DVG and 3DETR.

## Introduction

Visual grounding on 3D point clouds is an emerging vision and language task that benefits various applications in understanding the 3D visual world. By formulating this task as a grounding-by-detection problem, lots of recent works focus on how to exploit more powerful detectors and comprehensive language features, but (1) how to model complex relations for generating context-aware object proposals and (2) how to leverage proposal relations to distinguish the true target object from similar proposals are not fully studied yet. Inspired by the well-known transformer architecture, we propose a relation-aware visual grounding method on 3D point clouds, named as 3DVG-Transformer, to fully utilize the contextual clues for relation-enhanced proposal generation and cross-modal proposal disambiguation, relation-aware proposal generation and cross-modal feature fusion, which are enabled by a newly designed coordinate-guided contextual aggregation (CCA) module in the object proposal generation stage, and a multiplex attention (MA) module in the cross-modal feature fusion stage. With the aid of two proposed feature augmentation strategies to alleviate overfitting, we validate that our 3DVG-Transformer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, on two point cloud-based visual grounding datasets, ScanRefer and Nr3D/Sr3D from ReferIt3D, especially for complex scenarios containing multiple objects of the same category.


## Dataset & Setup

### Data preparation

*This codebase is built based on the initial [ScanRefer](https://github.com/daveredrum/ScanRefer) codebase. Please refer to [ScanRefer](https://github.com/daveredrum/ScanRefer) for more data preprocessing details.*

1. Download the ScanRefer dataset and unzip it under `data/`. 
2. Downloadand the preprocessed [GLoVE embeddings (~990MB)](http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/glove.p) and put them under `data/`.
3. Download the ScanNetV2 dataset and put (or link) `scans/` under (or to) `data/scannet/scans/` (Please follow the [ScanNet Instructions](data/scannet/README.md) for downloading the ScanNet dataset).

> After this step, there should be folders containing the ScanNet scene data under the `data/scannet/scans/` with names like `scene0000_00`

4. Pre-process ScanNet data. A folder named `scannet_data/` will be generated under `data/scannet/` after running the following command. Roughly 3.8GB free space is needed for this step:

```shell
cd data/scannet/
python batch_load_scannet_data.py
```

> After this step, you can check if the processed scene data is valid by running:
>
> ```shell
> python visualize.py --scene_id scene0000_00
> ```

5. (Optional) Pre-process the **multiview features** from ENet.

- Download:
    Download the ENet [multiview features (~36GB, hdf5 database)](http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/enet_feats.hdf5) and put it under `data/scannet/scannet_data/`

- Projection:

   a. Download [the ENet pretrained weights (1.4MB)](http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/ScanRefer/scannetv2_enet.pth) and put it under `data/`
   b. Download and decompress [the extracted ScanNet frames (~13GB)](http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/3dsis/scannet_train_images.zip).
   c. Change the data paths in `lib/config.py` marked with __TODO__ accordingly.
   d. Project ENet features from ScanNet frames to point clouds (~36GB, hdf5 database).


> ```shell
> python script/project_multiview_features.py --maxpool
> ```

### Setup
The code is tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS & 18.04 LTS with PyTorch 1.2.0 CUDA 10.0 installed.

Please refer to the initial [ScanRefer](https://daveredrum.github.io/ScanRefer/) for **pointnet2 packages** for the newer version (>=1.3.0) of PyTorch.

You could use other PointNet++ implementations for the lower version (<=1.2.0) of PyTorch.

```shell
conda install pytorch==1.2.0 torchvision==0.4.0 cudatoolkit=10.0 -c pytorch
```

Install the necessary packages listed out in `requirements.txt`:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After all packages are properly installed, please run the following commands to compile the CUDA modules for the PointNet++ backbone:
```shell
cd lib/pointnet2
python setup.py install
```
__Before moving on to the next step, please don't forget to set the project root path to the `CONF.PATH.BASE` in `lib/config.py`.__

## Usage

### Training
To train the 3DVG-Transformer model with multiview features:
```shell
python scripts/ScanRefer_train.py --use_multiview --use_normal --batch_size 8 --epoch 200 --lr 0.002 --coslr --tag 3dvg-trans+
```
settings:
XYZ: --use_normal
XYZ+RGB: --use_color --use_normal
XYZ+Multiview: --use_multiview --use_normal

For more training options (like using preprocessed multiview features), please run `scripts/train.py -h`.

### Evaluation
To evaluate the trained models, please find the folder under `outputs/` and run:
```shell
python scripts/ScanRefer_eval.py --folder <folder_name> --reference --use_multiview --no_nms --force --repeat 5 --lang_num_max 1
```
Note that the flags must match the ones set before training. The training information is stored in `outputs/<folder_name>/info.json`

Note that the results generated by ScanRefer_eval.py may be slightly lower than the test results during training. The main reason is that the results of model testing fluctuate, while the maximum value is reported during training, and we do not use a fixed test seed.

### Benchmark Challenge 

**Note that every user is allowed to submit the test set results of each method *only twice*, and the ScanRefer benchmark blocks update the test set results of a method for two weeks after a test set submission.**

After finishing training the model, please download [the benchmark data](http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/scanrefer_benchmark_data.zip) and put the unzipped `ScanRefer_filtered_test.json` under `data/`. Then, you can run the following script the generate predictions:

```shell
python benchmark/predict.py --folder <folder_name> --use_color
```

Note that the flags must match the ones set before training. The training information is stored in `outputs/<folder_name>/info.json`. The generated predictions are stored in `outputs/<folder_name>/pred.json`.
For submitting the predictions, please compress the `pred.json` as a .zip or .7z file and follow the [instructions](http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/scanrefer_benchmark/documentation) to upload your results.

### Visualization
![image-Visualization](demo/Visualization.png)

To predict the localization results predicted by the trained ScanRefer model in a specific scene, please find the corresponding folder under `outputs/` with the current timestamp and run:

```shell
python scripts/visualize.py --folder <folder_name> --scene_id <scene_id> --use_color
```
Note that the flags must match the ones set before training. The training information is stored in `outputs/<folder_name>/info.json`. The output `.ply` files will be stored under `outputs/<folder_name>/vis/<scene_id>/`

In our next version, the heatmap visualization code will be open-sourced in the 3DJCG (CVPR2022, Oral) codebase. 

The generated .ply or .obj files could be visualized in software such as **MeshLab**.
